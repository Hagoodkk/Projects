# Maze Solver

Maze solver takes as input a 2d array where:
1. Entries are delimited by commas
2. Barriers are represented by a '1'
3. Open paths are represented by a '0'
4. The exit is represented by a '9'

Maze solver runs Djikstra's algorithm and finds the shortest path from start to finish. It's a simple program put together mostly for me to use with JUnit Testing, Jenkins, and possibly Docker, to practice continuous integration and DevOp's.
