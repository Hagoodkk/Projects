# Projects

*In this section, you will find a collection of school projects for demonstration.*

**Table of Contents**
1. *Custom Hash Table Data Lookup* - hash table built using a custom LinkedList implementation. Allows for the lookup of city coordinates and calculations of distance between cities using command line entries.
2. *Cyber Security Password Management System* - system built on JavaFX and employs the H2 embedded database which allows users to securely store passwords.
3. *Djikstra's Algorithm Implementation* - takes in a weighted graph as input with cities as nodes and calculates the minimum travel cost between two of them.
4. *Heavy Duty Graph Node Experiment* - takes in a graph as input and runs a game where some nodes are chosen at random and marked as "capital nodes". Nodes of greatest influence are then deleted incrementally, and the game ends when a capital node is either deleted or completely disconnected from the rest of the graph. Data for each iteration is output and can be used to analyze best practices to ensure the the non-deletion/non-disconnection of important nodes.
5. *OS Simulation* - simulates an operating system's flow of job execution using a round-robin algorithm.
6. *Simple Client Server Architecture* - sets up a client/server where the client is enabled to download files from the server's space. Multitenancy version available, and both versions come with signal handlers to gracefully terminate download interruption.
7. *Hungr* - mobile development android app which recommends restaurants to its users. Uses geolocation services along with optional zip code, restaurant filtering is available, and users can retrieve contact information right from the app. Using the Yelp API.
